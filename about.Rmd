## Introduction: 

Movies have become a big part of everyday life worldwide and their popularity grow with time. In this project, we intend to explore the explanatory factors for the total gross, review scores and opening gross of movies that were released in North America from 2006 to 2016. We attempt to use linear regression model for each of three interested outcomes including total gross, review scores (metacritic review score) and opening gross. Our goal of analysis is to look into the relationship between a variable such as genre, actors/actresses, production company, director and review scores and each of our interested outcome variables. Mainly, there are three outcomes including total gross, review scores (metacritic review score) and opening gross that we are interested in for each movie in North America that was released from 2006 to 2016. 
## Data and methods:
* **Data source:**
* Domestic Box office: (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&sort=gross&order=DESC&&p=.htm) (Only use movies with total sales that ranked top 100)
* 06-16 movie: https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data
* **Data Description:** 
* The box office data was obtained by using a for-loop that scraped movies with total sales that ranked top 100 in each year from 2006 to 2016, resulting in a data frame containing 1100 rows and five variables: movie titles, studio, total gross, opening gross and released year.
* The movie dataset includes 1,000 most popular movies on IMDB (http://www.imdb.com/) from 2006 to 2016. The data points included are: Title, Genre, Description, Director, Actors, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue, Metascore for each movie. 
* **Data cleaning and scraping:**
* Firstly, we wrote a for-loop to scape the box office dataset from the online source which includes movies with total box office that ranked top 100 in each year from 2006 to 2016. After we changed the names of box office dataset for consistency, we joined the box office dataset with the movie dataset obtained from kaggle by the movie names. 
* Next, we cleaned our combined dataset. We decided to keep the total gross column and replaced NA in total gross with the values in Revenue column in movie dataset. Also, we divided the total gross by 10^6 to reduce the number of zeros in that column. Furthermore, we separated the actor column into four new columns for later analysis purpose.
* **Statistical analysis:**
* In this project, we mainly interested in analyzing the relationship between explanatory variable and outcome using linear regression model, specifically simple linear regression. Specifically, we hypothesized that there is a linear relationship between th explanatory variable(s) and outcome. Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two variables. Multiple linear regression is also one type of linear regression model and contains more than one explanatory variables. Both simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are used to explore the relationship between predictor variable(s) and the interested outcome. 
* lm function is used to fit a linear regression model to the interested explanatory variable(s) and dependent outcome. For simplicity, we used the P value (Pr>|t|) in each summarized lm() output to draw conclusion about whether the variable is significant predictor of the outcome. Commonly, we used 0.05 significance level to make conclusions. Moreover, lm function gives us the estimated coefficients (slope) for the linear model, which can used to predict how the outcome will change in response to the increase of the predictor.
* ANOVA is used when the explanatory variable has different levels/categories. Firstly, we used the ANOVA function to determine whether the variable as a whole is a significant predictor. Then we can explore the estimated coefficient for each level of that variable by using lm function. The estimated coefficient indicate how the outcome will change in response to the presence of a certain level/category of the predictor.
