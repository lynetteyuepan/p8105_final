>  Overview of the project goals and motivation.:

* Movies have become a big part of everyday life worldwide and their popularity grow with time. In this project, we intend to explore the explanatory factors for the total gross, review scores and opening gross of movies that were released in North America from 2006 to 2016. We attempt to use linear regression model for each of three interested outcomes including total gross, review scores (metacritic review score) and opening gross. Our goal of analysis is to look into the relationship between a variable such as genre, actors/actresses, production company, director and review scores and each of our interested outcome variables. Mainly, there are three outcomes including total gross, review scores (metacritic review score) and opening gross that we are interested in for each movie in North America that was released from 2006 to 2016.

> Initial questions and New Questions:

* At the beginning of our project, we intend to explore the relationship between review score, genre, actor, director and each of interested outcome, namely **total gross, review scores (metacritic review score) and opening gross** using linear Regression model.

> Data 

* Data Source:
    + [Box office](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&sort=gross&order=DESC&&p=.htm) 
    + [06-16 movie](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data)
    
> Exploratory analyasis:

* We make plots for: 

    + Distribution of movie genre
    + The top ranked type of movies with best box-office
    + The top ranked production company with best box-office
  
  
> Summary of Analysis:

* We use lm function and anova function to test if the factor that we are tested is a statistical significant predictor of the interested outcome.

* If the predictor is continous, we will fit a linear regression line to the data; if the predictor is categorical and contains many levels, we will use ANOVA function to check if the variable of interest is actually significant predictor.
